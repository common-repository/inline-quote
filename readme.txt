Introduces a button to the Wordpress WYSIWYG editor that allows the use of inline quotes.

== Description ==

The [HTML specification](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-q-element) defines the `<q>` tag as the semantically correct way of presenting quotes inline in HTML. This plugin adds a button to the WYSIWYG editor to allow you to use inline quotes instead of blockquotes where appropriate.

Once installed, you will see an additional button in the editor toolbar, next to the blockquote button.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
